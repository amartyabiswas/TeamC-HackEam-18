# TeamC-HackEam-18
##### HACKEAM’18, under the aegis of TEAMC, short for Towards Extensible and Adaptable Methods in Computing, was ideated in December, work on which was started with immediate effect, core team members pitching in suggestions on how to go about with the organization of the event, and how to make HACKEAM unique when compared to other hackathons so frequently.

##### HACKEAM’18 was a distinctly innovative hackathon featuring a carefully considered execution phase with insights from extremely renowned and experienced instructors. Division of HACKEAM’18 into 3 phases was decided upon, first of which involved participants undergoing interactive trek at various Places Of Interest (POI), exploring challenges in various social sectors, meanwhile creating a report of their experiences, identifying a prospective problem. This report will further constitute an essential part of the paper, presentation at TEAMC conference of which forms the third phase of HACKEAM’18.

We created a three tier data management system consisting of a super-admin, admin and members. It was developed concerning the needs of an NGO FXB Suraksha India. It felicitates centralized admission and data-handling of students connected with fxb. We identified their needs and their major concer was the handling of the admission documents, so we built a centralized admission system having the feature for adding, editing and managing admissions as well as the workers of the NGO. It has feature of filters, advanced Search for searching the names of the students admitted. We have the facility of uploading profile pictures. Their are three types of user namely:
  - Super-Admin
  - Admin
  - Member
  
Super-Admin can create Admin and Members and Admin can create Members. All of them can help enroll students. There are graphs and piecharts depicting the real world data.

## Main Highlights:
  - Three tier data management system.
  - Graphs and piecharts
  - Search and filters
  - Picture uploading
  - Use of mongodb, passport.js
  - Amazing Responsive layout
